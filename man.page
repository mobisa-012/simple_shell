.SH OWN SHLL
.PP
This manual is oriented towards understanding and using the functions
contained in the Own shell project, through which a shell is implemented
in the Linux operating system.
Here, the shell runs in a loop, which we know as a
Read\-Eval\-Print\-Loop or REPL.
The shell reads the input, parses it, and executes it, then loops to
read the next command, and so on until you enter a command such as exit,
shutdown, or reboot.
